## Localization Porfolio
### Introduction

Create a well-organized portfolio, with a single introductory page [don't stress about the length of this page, just make it clear] that concisely outlines and describes the contents.  Introduce it as you would to a future employer or graduate program, showing what you have accomplished this semester. (Note, you are not introducing this to the professor.)

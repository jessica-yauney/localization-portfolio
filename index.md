## Jessica Yauney's Localization Porfolio
### Introduction

This website outlines the work products created in BYU's Introduction to Localization Course. It provides evidence of the author's familiarity with the concepts of Localization as they apply within Software Development. Some of the content is real-life application of CAT Tools and other skills. Other parts of the content discuss localization from a more theoretical perspective.
 
### Projects
#### Project 1: Creating a localization project

I chose to use lingotek because it is one of the bigger CAT tools and I assumed there would be greater support if needed.<br/><br/>
I started creating my project by selecting a source material that has not been translated but I felt would be useful in multiple languages. I selected a blog post that explains how to use one aspect of the familysearch website. I configured my project with a due date for the course, the file type and to use machine translation and post editing. I chose this workflow because the passage is not particularly complex so I assumed that a machine translation with some human refinement would be sufficient. After setting up the project, I uploaded a pdf of the website that I wanted to translate. Then, it automatically completed the first stage in the workflow using machine translation. Then I worked through the post-edit step either approving or updating translations. The majority of changes that I made were to technology terms but other changes included updating information that was out of date and fixing a passage where the wrong meaning of “about” was used. As I completed this process it made me realize that I would have preferred to have someone else confirm the translation so an alternate workflow might have inspired more confidence.<br/><br/>
Overall, I felt like creating a project was relatively simple and the CAT tool did a lot to organize the process and to track progress. It succeeded in pulling out the text from a pdf of a website without errors. The machine translation happened without any human intervention and loaded into the next part of the workflow.<br/><br/>
However, I feel like there are things I could have done better. I assume that if I was using this tool as a part of a larger organization that there would be significantly greater standardization and greater use of tools that can be used on future projects. For example, as this was a single blog post I did not create a glossary even though there are specific terms pertinent to this software. I also did not create a significant document outlining style and instead just looked at another blog post to determine if it was written in tu or usted. Additionally, as I was the only one working on this project it did not matter that I did not assign people to tasks. If I was working in a group this would be an important step in the process. I also assume that there are features that I simply do not know how to use at this point. I would have preferred the option to view/restore machine translations after making changes in post-edit.<br/><br/>
In an attempt to overcome some of the challenges I faced the first time, I completed a second project that translates from Spanish to English instead. I used an html instead of a pdf and I added a review stage. I was significantly impressed by the system’s ability to handle complex html. It was interesting to note that some of the alt text of the spanish page was accidentally in English.<br/><br/>

### Final Essay
#### What is the future of localization?

If science fiction proves anything, it shows that predicting the future of technology is near impossible. Especially as a technologist, I view localization as being heavily interconnected with technology so I feel that the following predictions are supported but that many will be underestimations of the changes we will see while others may never happen. I believe that there are some current trends that will continue growing but there will also be some shifts in trajectory over time.
<br/><br/>
Currently localization is beginning to deal with the legalization of data localization requirements. Presently several countries have a variety of requirements for their citizens data including Russia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Iran, China, Brazil, India, Australia, Korea, and Nigeria. Presently the strictness of Russian law is incentivizing a shift toward data storage in the locality of users. Currently 3 states, California, Colorado, and Virginia have comprehensive data privacy laws. These laws are all newly adopted in the last 3 years and some are not in effect yet. In my opinion these requirements will push industry towards using large data center solutions, like AWS, so that companies do not need to be directly concerned with these issues. This may also push these data solution companies to increase their reach by adding additional centers in more countries. While this will probably increase the cost for technology companies it has the potential to improve access (decrease latency) in many localities.
<br/><br/>
As is true for many fields, some processes in localization, including translation, are becoming increasingly automated. As automated translation becomes even better, I believe demand for translation will continually decrease. Automated subtitling is growing in software like Youtube and has the potential to expand access. However, as seen in many similar areas, the loss of jobs to computerized processes may lead to the creation of new roles that are more creative. As professionals are no longer needed to complete translations, they are now able to complete more complex localization including cultural adaptation. Additionally, as the development of content continues to grow significantly and as the demand for localization increases these automated tools may be necessary to keep up with increased demand.
<br/><br/>
I believe that localization will continue to expand both in the proportion of websites that have been localized and the number of localities considered. For example, FamilySearch was originally available in only 1 language, before being translated in 10 languages, and was finally translated into a total of 30 languages in 2020. In attempting to increase access, companies will need to increase their consideration for local constraints. One constraint is the amount of data required for use of a resource. While the amount of data may affect speed in many first-world countries it is of only mild concern, in many third-world countries the quantity of data can impact the cost to the user of using the website. Additionally, as companies seek to increase access they presently have to add languages that are spoken by fewer people and are thus harder to have translated. However, in the longer term these smaller languages may disappear, at least as primary languages. Presently 3 percent of people account for 96 percent of languages spoken.
<br/><br/>
Specifically in reference to our research regarding specific careers within localization it is interesting to compare my personal expectations about career field growth to the U.S. governments’ predictions. Our research into desktop publishing revealed a prediction that the field would decline over the next ten years. While I understand their argument that many of these processes are being automated or made easier, I believe that the skills needed will remain useful as more documents are accessed digitally and user interfaces need to be tailored to localized content instead of static documents. Interpreters and translators are expected to grow by 24% which is growing faster than average occupations. This seems very reasonable to me. Maybe, most interesting is how the U.S. Bureau of Labor handles project management. It refers to project management as “cost estimators” and expects there to be no change in demand over time which is an effective decrease as population increases. In my opinion as technology becomes more integral to many processes project management is even more important. It also does not surprise me that captioners are projected to grow slower than average as this is already an area that is being automated. For example, as a recent conference that I attended, the captioner was so inaccurate I would have preferred an automated captioner.
<br/><br/>
The specialization of products is particularly interesting. As companies grow and attempt to expand into foreign markets they often need to specialize their product. This has allowed many companies to have great success with examples like McDonald’s specialized menus. However, we have also seen over time that culture is becoming more homogenous as different customs spread around the world. I would not be surprised if the global market became increasingly homogenous especially as mass production of the same product is more cost effective. However, I also believe there will continue to be specialized products as a part of some cultures.
<br/><br/>
Overall, localization is only going to grow but it may look substantially different as time continues.

## Jessica Yauney's Localization Porfolio
### Introduction

This website outlines the work products created in BYU's Introduction to Localization Course. It provides evidence of the author's familiarity with the concepts of Localization as they apply within Software Development. Some of the content is real-life application of CAT Tools and other skills. Other parts of the content discuss localization from a more theoretical perspective.
 
### Projects
#### Project 1: Creating a localization project

Source file
Target file<br/><br/>
I chose to use lingotek because it is one of the bigger CAT tools and I assumed there would be greater support if needed.<br/><br/>
I started creating my project by selecting a source material that has not been translated but I felt would be useful in multiple languages. I selected a blog post that explains how to use one aspect of the familysearch website. I configured my project with a due date for the course, the file type and to use machine translation and post editing. I chose this workflow because the passage is not particularly complex so I assumed that a machine translation with some human refinement would be sufficient. After setting up the project, I uploaded a pdf of the website that I wanted to translate. Then, it automatically completed the first stage in the workflow using machine translation. Then I worked through the post-edit step either approving or updating translations. The majority of changes that I made were to technology terms but other changes included updating information that was out of date and fixing a passage where the wrong meaning of “about” was used. As I completed this process it made me realize that I would have preferred to have someone else confirm the translation so an alternate workflow might have inspired more confidence.<br/><br/>
Overall, I felt like creating a project was relatively simple and the CAT tool did a lot to organize the process and to track progress. It succeeded in pulling out the text from a pdf of a website without errors. The machine translation happened without any human intervention and loaded into the next part of the workflow.<br/><br/>
However, I feel like there are things I could have done better. I assume that if I was using this tool as a part of a larger organization that there would be significantly greater standardization and greater use of tools that can be used on future projects. For example, as this was a single blog post I did not create a glossary even though there are specific terms pertinent to this software. I also did not create a significant document outlining style and instead just looked at another blog post to determine if it was written in tu or usted. Additionally, as I was the only one working on this project it did not matter that I did not assign people to tasks. If I was working in a group this would be an important step in the process. I also assume that there are features that I simply do not know how to use at this point. I would have preferred the option to view/restore machine translations after making changes in post-edit.<br/><br/>
In an attempt to overcome some of the challenges I faced the first time, I completed a second project that translates from Spanish to English instead. I used an html instead of a pdf and I added a review stage. I was significantly impressed by the system’s ability to handle complex html. It was interesting to note that some of the alt text of the spanish page was accidentally in English.<br/><br/>
